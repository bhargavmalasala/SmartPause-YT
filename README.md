# YouTube Auto Pause/Play Extension

This project is a lightweight browser extension that enhances the YouTube watching experience by automatically managing video playback based on tab activity. When the user switches away from the YouTube tab, the extension pauses the video so no content is missed. When the user returns to the tab, playback resumes automatically, offering a seamless and uninterrupted experience.

The extension includes a simple toggle switch in the popup that allows users to enable or disable the auto-pause feature at any time. It works smoothly with YouTube’s dynamic interface and requires only minimal permissions. Designed for productivity and convenience, this extension is ideal for users who multitask while watching videos.

## Features
